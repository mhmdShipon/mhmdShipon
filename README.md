- ⚡ Fun fact: Beyond the world of tech, I'm an avid chess player. The strategic depth of chess fascinates me, and I find its complexity and elegance a refreshing contrast to coding. It's taught me patience, strategy, and the importance of thinking several moves ahead, skills that greatly benefit my programming and problem-solving approach.
